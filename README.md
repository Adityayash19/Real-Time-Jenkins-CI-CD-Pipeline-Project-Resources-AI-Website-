# Real-Time Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Project | Resources & AI Website

This project is a clone of the Flipkart website, built using AI, HTML, and CSS, and deployed through a real-time Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. The project demonstrates how modern DevOps tools can be integrated to automate build, test, and deployment workflows.

🚀 Features

✦ Flipkart-like responsive UI using HTML & CSS

✦ Jenkins CI/CD pipeline integration

✦ SonarQube for static code analysis & quality gates

✦ Dependency-Check for security vulnerability scanning

✦ Maven for build and dependency management

✦ Docker for containerization and deployment

🛠️ Workflow
